                <p className="card-text">We want to encourage a healthy, active lifestyle amongst NUS students, who may be too overwhelmed with studies to organize a sports session.</p>
                <p className="card-text">With <b>Sport-Match</b>, we aim to bypass the hassle of looking for court availabilities and playmates by streamlining the entire process.</p>
                <p className="card-text">Users can conveniently see which sports facility at which time and make bookings for the court. If there are not enough players, they can also use the Sport-Match platform to allow others to join.</p>
                <p className="card-text">Ultimately, <b>Sport-Match</b> is as much as facility-booking tool as well as a player-matching platform. </p>
                <p className="font-weight-bold">Make Friends, while being Active.</p>
